### OneFeed
An experiment in unifying social media feeds. Made to practice:
 - program design - particularly the MVC & blackboard frameworks
 - parallelism
 - login management and security
 - APIs (both using them and defining them to facilitate extensibility)

### Components:
Primary components:
 - OneFeed: MVC model, also the board for the internal blackboard. Starts Feeds & generally coordinates.
 - OneFeedView: MVC view, the usual.
 - OneFeedController: 

### Feeds:
 - DummyFeed: 

UNFORTUNATELY, Facebook does not allow apps to read the newsfeed *OR* their own notifications
without official review, and specifically says "Desktop apps will not be granted [these] permission[s]".

###To-do:
 - CURRENTLY REFACTORING THIS LIST IS ROCKY
